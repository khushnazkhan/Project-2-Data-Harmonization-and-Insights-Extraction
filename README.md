**Bike Rental Prediction Project**
Overview
This project explores the relationship between various weather and time-related features and bike rentals in a city. The goal is to analyze how factors like temperature, weather conditions, and time of day impact the number of bike rentals, and to develop a deeper understanding of the factors influencing bike rental demand.

Bike Rental Prediction Project
Overview
This project explores the relationship between various weather and time-related features and bike rentals in a city. The goal is to analyze how factors like temperature, weather conditions, and time of day impact the number of bike rentals, and to develop a deeper understanding of the factors influencing bike rental demand.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about bike rentals, including columns such as:

Instant: Time index
Date: Date of rental
Season: The season of the year (1: Spring, 2: Summer, 3: Fall, 4: Winter)
Temperature (temp): Temperature in Celsius
Apparent Temperature (atemp): The apparent temperature, in Celsius
Humidity (hum): Humidity percentage
Windspeed: Windspeed (in km/h)
Casual: Number of casual users (not registered)
Registered: Number of registered users
Total Rentals (cnt): Total number of bike rentals (sum of casual and registered users)
Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project includes detailed EDA with visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, bar plots, and scatter plots to better understand the relationships between variables.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap shows the correlation between various features to identify significant relationships and potential features for modeling.
Scatter Plots: Visualize relationships between numeric variables such as temperature and bike rentals.
Box Plots and Histograms: Distribution of variables to identify outliers, trends, and data imbalances.
Objectives
Investigate how factors such as temperature, weather conditions, and time of day affect bike rental usage.
Visualize key relationships between features in the dataset.
Provide insights into seasonal patterns and outliers in the data.
Develop a foundational understanding of how these features contribute to bike rental demand.
